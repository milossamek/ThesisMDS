# ThesisMDS - Multidimensional point data structure algorithms - visualization of evolution. 
Technology used in thesis: Spring, Vaadin, Hibernate, ProcessingJS

# Abstract
The primary topic of this thesis is visualization of data structures used to store multidimensional
point data and their operations. Specifically, this thesis covers visualisations of the priority
search tree, range tree and two quad tree specifications. The secondary goal was to create visualisations
of linear orderings of Peano curve, Hilbert curve and Z-curve.

# Keywords
Data structures, visualization, range tree, quad tree, priority search tree, Z-curve, linear ordering,
Peano curve, Hilbert curve 

# Critique
The javascript animation part is something that I'm not happy with and it's worth revising it
